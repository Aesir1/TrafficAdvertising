![Project image](/Media/DSC_0218.JPG)


## Project abstract
This project has the goal of simulating data collection through sensors, persisting the information in a relational database and modeling the information in an accessible form as bar graphs.

## Requirements
### Hardware
    - Arduino Uno with cable
    - HC-SR501 Pir Sensor
    - HC-SR04 Ulrasonic Sensor
    - 74HC595 16 pin 
    - Leds (2-green, 2 yellow, 2 red)
    - 6 Resistors
    - Potentiometer (1)
    - wires (M-M, F-M)
    - Computer
### Software
    - Arduino compiler
    - NodeRed
    - Sql Database server (MSSQL for example)

### Node-Red
All Node-Red data is inside **"flows node red.json"** you might need to change the user and password for db connection.
<br />
Once Node-Red is installed run the following on the command prompt.
 >node-red 
 
### Sql database
Database related data could be found inside **"TrafficAdvertising.sql"**.
<br />
Please notice you need to create a db user and password or could use the other auth process. 

## Media and related data
Photos related to project could be found inside **"Media"** folder
